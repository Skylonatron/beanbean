#### Tips
* If any files are being added that are getting created automatically then add to .gitignore. Only push up code that you have updated.

#### Bugs
* When spinning bean sometimes they get split a few cells apart. Not sure why this is occuring. To recreate spin rapidly when between two sets of cells.
